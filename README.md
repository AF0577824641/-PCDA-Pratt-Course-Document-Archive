# Pratt Course Document Archive (PCDA)

The Pratt Course Document Archive (PCDA) is a database designed to support Pratt Institute students and faculty in organizing and accessing academic course materials. Its purpose is to manage class documents and reading lists in a structured and searchable manner. This project aims to streamline the retrieval of scholarly materials by linking documents to specific syllabi. This connection will enable users to easily locate related materials across different courses, simplifying access to relevant content and improving citation discovery for academic use.
